All c programs in this directory require the following format. Otherwise, the 'c_program_reference_simulator.sh' 
might produce an invalid reference output for them.

Format requirements:

- Must contain a main function
- They should not contain any IO statements such as 'printf()'. 
    All communication with the outside world is done though the final return statement.
- The program's final result must be stored inside a variable
- This variable must be returned from the main function (Do no return a function call)

See 'fibonacci.c' as an example of a valid c program.
